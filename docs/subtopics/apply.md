Effectively searching and applying for the correct role can be hard but having a framework can help reduce waste of time and effort.

## Let's search for a job (as I would do)

### Set up job filter 

1. Position/designation: Based on **relevant** years of experience.
2. Tech stack: Do some research using the tech stack. Could be the stack you have worked with, or the stack you want to work on. Usually its a balance between the two. Like is it JVM stack (Java, Scala) or GoLang stack or Ruby on Rails stack etc.
3. Search for areas to work in: Platform, Tools, Cloud, API, Distributed Systems, Mobile Apps, Frontend SPAs, Enterprise Apps etc 
4. (For non EU) Company visa support: Do you need & Does it mention something explicitly
5. (For non EU) Language requirements: Does it mention **Native** speakers of certain language. Native means raised and optionally born in that region.
