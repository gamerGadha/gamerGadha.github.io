Effectively searching and applying for the correct role can be hard but having a framework can help reduce waste of time and effort.

## Let's search for a job (as I would do)

### Set up job filter 

1. Position/designation: Based on **relevant** years of experience.
2. Tech stack: Do some research using the tech stack. Could be the stack you have worked with, or the stack you want to work on. Usually its a balance between the two. Like for backend is it JVM stack (Java, Scala) or GoLang stack or Ruby on Rails stack etc.
3. Search for areas to work in: Platform, Tools, Cloud, API, Distributed Systems, Mobile Apps, Frontend SPAs, Enterprise Apps etc 
4. (For non EU) Company visa support: Do you need & Does it mention something explicitly
5. (For non EU) Language requirements: Does it mention **Native** speakers of certain languages. Native means raised and optionally born in that region. It is rare but mostly found in customer engineering roles.

### LinkedIn Research

1. Find & connect with recruiters & engineering managers in linkedin who are based in Ireland.
2. Search LinkedIn jobs with the company name to understand if there is a hiring spree going on.
3. Follow the company and hashtag to see if there is a lot of new hire activity.
4. Drop a message with the joblink to the recruiter if it is of interest.
5. If the company is known to hire more from referrals then **politely request** for referral from an existing employee in LinkedIn with the job link in their career site.
6. Also remember jobs in LinkedIn and in the company's career site might be out of sync. In that case, company career site is the source of truth.

### Other Platforms
1. Glassdoor
2. Indeed
